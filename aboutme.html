    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a full-time student at Naples High School with a 3.4 GPA. I am a superior violinist and an athlete. I live in Naples Florida but was born in Maine. I live with both of my parents, my younger brother, 2 cats and 2 dogs. 

I have played many sports, (Soccer, Volleyball, Cheerleading etc.) and care very dearly for athleticism. I also love to write, draw, paint, and let my creative side really shine through! I also practice my religion, Christianity, and go to church pretty frequently. 

My goals for college are to go to University of Miami for business, be on the cheerleading squad, and take a creative writing class. After college, I want to be married with a few kids, have a house on the beach, and run a successful business. To work towards these goals, I strive in the high school orchestra, stay active in sports and the gym, and maintain a GPA of at least 3.0. I also am currently looking for a job which will aid my experience and maturity.
